# Godot-ID3-tag-script
This is a GDscript script made for Godot 4 that reads ID3 metadata from an MP3 file. 

This is a script I intend to use in some projects of mine, but I figured, since those projects are going to be a ways away, I will release this, cause I'm sure some other Godot devs could use it. 

Very WIP
